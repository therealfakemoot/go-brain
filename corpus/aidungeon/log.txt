It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky, then that made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.

You were thirsty and hungry, but the sun was out so you figured it would be a good idea to get some food first. You saw a few small animals wandering around nearby, but they didn't seem threatening enough for you to want to kill them right away.

After getting some water from the well, you went back to look for something else. You found a bunch of rocks on top of a hill and decided to climb down into the valley below. It wasn't very high though; you just needed to find another way down.

Eventually you got to the bottom of the valley and saw a lot of trees, which seemed pretty far away. You could see an old road going through here somewhere. Maybe if you followed it, you'd be able to get back home!
You heard a growl and saw a few hairy creatures appear on the hill you had just come down. They looked like the drawings of the "yeti" you saw in some of your comic books. That was one of the things you drew on your map too!
You didn't know what to call them though.
You had to get back up top before they saw you. They looked like they could be pretty fast; you needed to get some distance so you could outrun them!

There was a thick tree near you. If you ran around it and kept going the same way, you would eventually be at the same height as the valley floor. You could hide behind a tree and wait until the creatures were gone, then inch your way up and run back home when you were on even ground again!
The creatures went back up the hill without ever seeing you. You waited a few more minutes to make sure they were gone for good, then started running back home.
You only kept the smoothest of body parts in your bag. You knew, hiding in this dark alley, you would be adding to it soon.

The man who was holding a torch looked at you and said, "I'm sorry about that." He then turned his attention back to the street. The other one didn't say anything either. They were both looking at you now with an expression of disgust on their faces.

"Are you okay?" he asked again. This time he seemed to be trying to make eye contact with you as well.

He continued walking down the street and disappeared into another building before turning around and coming back out with a small flashlight in hand.

"What are you doing?" you ask.

"Just checking if I found anyone else," he replies. "There's no point in keeping this thing on me all night." He turns off the light and goes back inside his building.
"You're a paramedic. Why would you do that?" you ask as he closes the door.
"It's where I sleep," he replies, "and I'm not on duty right now. Goodnight."
"Why were you on duty in the first place?"
"Good question. I'm not really sure. It's just something I do when I have time..."
"Well, thanks anyway... for everything."
You leave the paramedic and head back to your "bedroom."
The paramedic's story was odd. You wanted to ask him more, but you also didn't want to push your luck. He didn't give off a bad vibe though. If anything, he seemed pleasant. His partner on the other hand... you couldn't quite read him. Something was going on with them, that was sure.
But at least now you had a decent place to keep all your baggage. You would have to come back here every now and then just to make sure it wasn't disturbed though.
His name is Wet Dream and he's been laying under Colton's bed for the past few hours.
"Finally," he says, pulling his glistening penis from your mouth. "I was beginning to think this bitch didn't know how to take a dick correct."
Wet Dream is a legendary juggalo. His mixtape, Peepshow, has a 5.0 on the Internet Ratings Index, the highest ranked album ever. He is one of the best music producers alive. He wears dark sunglasses and clown make up, like most juggalos.
He is a Faygo Knight, the highest rank one can achieve in the InsaneClown Posse fan club. He is covered in dozens of tattoos dedicated to ICP. His arms, legs, chest, and back are completely covered in them.
He has a large black hat with a long pink feather sticking out of it. His hat has sparkles on it, like a low-class hooker.
He wears black and blue board shorts, and a black wife beater. His arms, chest, and neck are as thick as a refrigerator. He has long, curly black hair, and a goatee.
He smiles at you, showing off a mouth full of yellow and rotten teeth.
"If you ever want a blowie again, you gotta let me cum inside ya."
You look at him, confused.
"What?" you ask.
"Come on, we ain't got all day," he says. "Let's get it over with."
He grabs your head and begins to force his cock into your mouth. You gag, but try not to cry out.
"Mmm... Mm! Fuckkkk!" he says, as you gulp down his jizz.
The next thing you feel is wetness entering your ass.
"Fuck, that felt good," you say.
"Yeah, yeah... Let's do it again sometime," Wet Dream says.
You shake your head no.
"Come on, baby. I know you want to..."
Wet Dream crawls out from under your bed, and leaves your room.
"Hey Dad, I'm home!" you yell.
"Is your homework done?" he calls back.
"Yeah!"
"Alright then, come set the table. Dinner's almost ready."
"OK!" you yell.
After setting the table and waiting an eternity, your father finally calls you to eat. You sit down and enjoy your meal of spaghetti and meatballs.
Your mother's been on a trip to Paris for the past three months.
She sends you and your father postcards every day. Once she returns you can talk to her in person. She's says she has a surprise for you.
After your finished eating, you wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. When you're finished with that, it's already dark outside.
"I'll be in my room," you say.
"Alright, hun," he says.
You run to your room and see a note on your pillow. It's from Wet Dream.
Thanks for the sloppy bj, whore.
Hope you enjoyed it, because I recorded it.
I'm going to post this on YouTube.
Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame."The whole school's talking about you," he says.
"Really?" you ask. "Like what?"
"Like how you gave a blowjob to Wet Dream in exchange for music lessons."
As you descended through the clouds, you couldn't help but marvel at your new party dress. You had to catch yourself from daydreaming too long; the attack had begun.

You saw a few of the smaller ships that were attacking the capital ship and they looked like they belonged in some fantasy movie. They weren't just sailing around it though, these vessels actually attacked it with their own cannons! The sight was truly amazing.

The battle for the capital ship was going well. It seemed as if the whole fleet was on its last legs when it suddenly began to turn around and head back towards you. This left you no choice but to continue heading towards the capital ship.

When you finally reached it, there was nothing standing between you and victory except for one lone vessel. A large cannon mounted on this vessel fired a shot which hit your ship directly, causing it to explode into pieces.
You couldn't be certain, but you think that you actually briefly glimpsed the bottom of the vessel before you were killed.

Part of you knew that dissecting your own hand was a bad idea, but you've already gone this far - there's no way you cold stop now.

You start to feel the pain in your arm and it's enough for you to pull out your knife. You quickly cut through some of the skin on your forearm and then use the blade to carve out a small hole so you can breathe. It doesn't take long before you're able to get air into your lungs again.

As much as you want to just lie down and die right here, something inside of you tells you that you need to keep going. So you do what any self-respecting survivor would do: you crawl back up onto the table and continue to look at yourself in the mirror.
You can see that your ears have begun to take a pointy shape. It will be a long time before people start making comments about them, but they will. Your eyebrows are slightly thicker and more unruly than they once were and their color has begun to darken. Your skin has become slightly darker as well thanks to your days in the mines, but not by much. Thankfully, you'll be able to stay out of the desert sun with no problems.

Your hair has grown longer and shaggier and it has reached down to your shoulders. It will be much longer still before it starts to poke out from under your miner's cap.
As for your teeth, they've begun to sharpen somewhat, but that won't be noticeable for a few more years.
Then there are the symptoms. The pain in your joints has subsided slightly. It will return with a vengeance in a few years. Your senses have become sharper and your reflexes are quicker. You haven't noticed any physical changes, but they must be there.
You look at your hands again and see the paw-like things you've become. You doubt if you'll ever be able to play your beloved lute like this. Still, you've gotten pretty good at playing the mandolin. It's just not the same, but at least it keeps you sane.
You're about to turn away from the mirror when the door opens up. It's the foreman with a man you don't recognize. They both walk over to you and the foreman starts to speak.
"Ah there you are. I'd like you to meet our new miner, Ian. He'll be working the same section as you starting today."
You stare at the unfamiliar man. He looks a few years younger than you, but it's hard to tell. It's not like there's been any new workers in your section for years. Now two show up the same day. There must be something going on you're not aware of.
"Pleased to meet you Ian." You say extending your hand.
Ian shakes it and then looks at his own hand as if it's something foreign to him. He tries to smile, but it looks more like a snarl.
"Nice to meet you as well." He says in an accent you don't recognize.
His voice sounds funny as well. Not funny ha-ha, but funny strange. You can't even place if it's a northern or southern accent. You've never met anyone from the mainland before, so you have no reference point. Maybe he's from one of the many islands out on the ocean, but that seems unlikely as well given how far away they all are.
"When did you get in?" You ask.
"Just now. The foreman was kind enough to fetch me from the docks and take me to the tavern so I could wet my throat before coming here." He says.
You turn to the foreman who nods.
"I figured he should start working as soon as possible, so I had him grab his tools and meet me here." He says.
Ian looks down at the table and holds back a laugh.
You glare at him and then look back at the foreman.
"What's so funny?" You ask.
Ian holds up one of his hands and wiggles his fingers as if playing a tiny piano.
"Is this some sort of test?" He asks with a chuckle.
Now you're getting annoyed. The foreman speaks up before you can say anything.
"I don't know what you mean." He says.
Ian turns his attention to the foreman and stops playing with his fingers.
"You tell a very funny joke, but I have to say I don't get it." He says.
"I'm not joking." The foreman says with a frown.
The three of you stand in silence until Ian shrugs and sighs.
"Maybe it's a very subtle joke, then." He says.
The three of you look at each other in silence until you can't contain yourself any longer. You burst out laughing and continue for a minute or two.
Ian looks on in surprise and the foreman soon joins you. Ian smiles, but doesn't seem to get it. He eventually laughs as well, but still seems confused.
"What's so funny?" He asks.
The three of you continue to laugh for a while, but you finally compose yourself.
"Let's just say that 'getting it' depends on where you're from." You explain.
The foreman nods in agreement.
"Enough about jokes, we should get to work." He says.
You and Ian start to gather your tools and head back to the mining site. On the way there Ian asks you about the joke, but you just tell him that he wouldn't get it anyway. He seems to accept that. The three of you spend the rest of your day working and then head home together.
Over the next few days, Ian adapts to your way of life in the mines and you begin working on your routine. Your days become fairly mundane, but you have to admit that you enjoy it. The three of you keep to each other's company outside of work as well becoming fairly commonplace.
One day, you're coming back from getting your rations when you notice a group of dwarves huddled around something, but the entrance to your tunnel is in the way so you can't see what they're looking at. As you get closer, you hear one of the dwarves say something about an attack.
"What's going on here?" You ask.
All the dwarves turn and look at you, but say nothing. You repeat your question, but again get no answer. One of the dwarves walks away from the group and approaches you. It's not until he gets close that you realize it's Graham, the head miner.
"Do you remember me?" He asks.
You contemplate his question for a moment. Your first thought is to say no, but something about him seems familiar. You finally put your finger on it.
"Graham? The miner that got stuck under the rock slide?" You ask.
He smiles and nods.
"I never knew your name, but your face is familiar." You explain.
"You helped free me."
"Oh yeah, now I remember. How are you? You look healthy."
"I'm great now. Most of my wounds have healed, I've been taking it easy though."
"Well that's good. Glad to hear it."
You look over at the other dwarves. They're still watching, but now are whispering among themselves.
"What's going on?" You ask.
"I think you should come with me." Graham says.
"Where?"
"Somewhere we can talk."
You don't like the sound of that, but he's still one of your dwarves so you nod. He walks back towards the group of dwarves and you follow after him. He leads you around the corner and out of sight of the other dwarves.
"I know why you're here." He says.
"You do?" You ask.
"Yes, and I also know that you'll be leaving soon."
"What? How do you know that?"
"I went for a walk yesterday and heard some of the miners talking. They said you had come here to kill the Dark Lady."
"Yeah, well I was a bit rash with that."
"Yeah, well I bet you're glad they stopped you." Graham replies.
You're surprised to hear him say that, given what he's about to ask you.
"Well now that I know the whole story, would you kill her?"
You had a feeling he was going to ask you that question. You just aren't sure of the answer. You've been thinking more about it and if things were different, you would agree. If this were peacetime and you didn't have obligations to your family, then you would have gone through with it.
"I... I don't know. I want to say yes, but..." You start to say.
"But what? Don't you want to kill her?" Graham asks in disbelief.
"Well yeah, but..."
Graham's expression turns to one of anger.
"I can't believe this." He says.
"What?"
"You had the chance and now you're pissing it away! Do you not have any guts?!" Graham yells.
"I have guts, I just..."
"Do you not want to avenge my son's death?!" Graham yells again.
"It's not that I don't want to..."
Graham brings his hand back and cuffs you hard in the face.
You take a step back as he balls up his other fist.
"Well you better want to or you're not fit to be a dwarf!" He yells and swings at you.
You block his punch and return one of your own, knocking him to the ground. You immediately kneel down beside him.
"I'm sorry!" You exclaim.
Graham holds his cheek as he stares at the ground. Tears well up in his eyes, but don't fall. He takes a deep breath, then lets it out and looks at you.
"You're going to have to kill them all." He says.
"What?" You ask.
"If you really want to do this, you'll have to kill everyone in the fortress. Starting with me." Graham explains.
"What are you talking about? I don't want to kill anyone, I just want to..."
Graham pounds his fist against the ground in frustration before looking up at you.
"I want justice for my son! And the only way I'm going to get it is if everyone involved in his death is put to death!" He yells.
You take a deep breath and let it out.
You take a deep breath and let it out.

> You fart so hard the entire mountain explodes and the dark lady chokes on her pretzel.
You let out a quick burst of fire, immediately burning off the lining of your own mouth and throat. You begin to cough violently and wretch as you roll about on the ground in pain. The smell is beyond horrible. It smells like the very depths of hell.
"By Moradin's shining balls! What is that smell?! Oh wait, I know that smell! Fucking hell, I think it's eating through the cloth!" You hear Stinky shouting in the distance as you continue to cough out the flames.
You attempt to stop your spasms long enough to roll away from the carnage you've created, but can't quite muster the coordination. You're not even aware of what's going on around you any more as you experience one long prelude to death.
After an unknown amount of time, you black out.
"Huh? What? Where am I?" You hear a voice say as you begin to come around.
"Shit! He's not dead yet! Quick, get the oil!" Another voice exclaims.
"No, don't waste the oil, we're almost there. He's not going to last much longer." A third voice says.
"Why not just leave him then?"
"He could still hang on. Better to be sure."
"Fine, fine."
You feel yourself being dragged and then feel an odd sort of peace and quiet. It almost makes you want to fall asleep, but you're aware enough to realize you've been buried... alive.
The voices are still going on above you. You're not entirely sure you want to hear what they're saying, so you just focus on the odd comfort of your wooden coffin.
"Quick! Grab the other end, we need to get out of here before those minotaurs show up!" A voice exclaims.
"What about the other two?"
"Fuck 'em, let the wolves have 'em."
"Them and their stupid plan."
The voices begin to fade as you are overwhelmed by the realization of where you are. You can't move anything but your head, and eventually you run out of air.
"Hello, is anyone there?" You say, just before you black out.
"Graham! Graham! Get your ass over here! We need to get moving!" You hear a voice yell.
You feel hands grab you and your body is dragged along the ground.
"Fucking idiots used way too much wood. Didn't even line the inside. Still, should burn well enough."
Then you're tossed into a cart. You open your eyes and see at least three bodies already in there. The one in the driver's seat turns around to look at you.
"Ah, you're awake. Good, we have much to do and little time to do it in."
The man has a strange accent you've never heard before.
"Who are you?" You ask.
"Me? My name is Olaf. Now get up, we have a lot to do."
The mountain explodes and wakes God up from his nap. He's really pissed off by how annoying his creations are being and he is tired of their bullshit. He unleashes a wave of fire that immolates everyone and everything it touches. The only thing left is the planet Earth covered in an ocean of lava. God Realizes that he's went too far and also realizes he will eventually go too far again. He therefore destroys himself because he isn't powerful enough to handle such a chaotic universe without getting pissed off at it.
"Hello, I am Dr. Henry Jekyll and this is my assistant Mr. Edward Hyde." The voice of the robotic duo says as they both look at you. "We have been tasked to build a perfect model of yourself that can serve mankind for years to come."

"I see..." You say as you try to figure out what their plan is. "So...what do we need?"

"Well, firstly your head, then your body will follow shortly after." The voice replies.

"What does that mean? How do we get them?" You ask.

"Simple, we take a sample of your blood and inject it into one of our robots." The voice answers.
"So...wait? You're going to kill one of your robots for my body?" You ask.
"Yes, but don't worry the process is completely painless, and they don't really feel anything as they are just machines." The voice answers.
"That doesn't make me feel any better, what about my head?" You ask.
"Ah, once we have your body the rest is easy, we just need to cut off your head and then put it in a special container that gives your face the ability to move and talk." The voice answers.
"Why are you giving all this detail?" You ask.
"So you know what is going on and you can't back out." The voice states coldly. "So, do we have a deal?"

You take a deep breath and think about it...
Well you didn't really have a choice. The downside of your brain being placed into a life support system is that you will slowly lose your memories as the brain naturally deteriorates. Here at least you will be getting a new healthy body and a chance to continue your work.
There is also the fact that you will still be alive...sort of.
"Yes, I accept your terms." You finally say.
"Perfect, I knew you would see things our way." The voice answers. "Now this might pinch a bit..."
"Wait!" You say before you feel two needles slide into your neck. You feel a slight pinch as they inject something into you.
"There we go, that should help you forget whatever it is you need to forget, now then repeat after me...."
You begin to repeat the words but then you feel your entire body begin to shake. You feel it getting hard to breath and then...
"Ah shit!" You groan as you open your eyes and find yourself staring at a very blurry screen.
"What the fuck man, my head hurts." You say as you begin to adjust to the screen in front of you and realize that you are looking at a camera. "What year is it?" You ask.
"The year: 2070, September 18th." A voice answers causing you to look around and find yourself inside some sort of building. You are surprised to find that you are in a tank of water. "Don't worry, the water soothes the brain and allows it to heal itself, you'll be able to get out in a few minutes." The voice answers your unasked question.
"Where the hell am I?" You ask.
"You are in the Neucom research building, you were rescued by one of our drones after your ship was destroyed in orbit." The voice answers.
"My ship? What happened?" You ask.
"In time you will need to be briefed, right now you need to get your body moving again as it has been asleep for a long time." The voice says.
You take a deep breath and swim to the edge of your tank. You put your legs down and nearly fall over, but manage to steady yourself.
"How long was I under?" You ask.
"21 years." The voice answers.
"Jesus..." You say. "I feel like I just went to bed thinking I had a test the next day..."
"Well, the way your brain works that's more or less what happened." The voice replies.
You begin to walk around your tank and try to get a feel for how your body reacts. After a bit of stumbling and almost falling a few times you manage to get yourself under control. "Alright, I'm ready." You say.
"To get your briefing?" The voice asks.
"No, to get out of here." You reply.
"I'm afraid that won't be possible." The voice states.
"What do you mean?" You ask.
"This facility is locked down, there have been...riots outside, we're unsure what's going on but we think the government has fallen. Until things calm down out there we're stuck in here." The voice answers.
"That's ridiculous, if the government fell then the Marines would be stepping in not rioting..." You say before you are interrupted.
"The Marines are also rioting, we don't know why but soon as they found out the news they began assaulting various government buildings and officials."
The voice explains. "Sadly we've been unable to get in contact with any of them to find out what's going on, it's like they've all gone mad. Besides the police force we're the only force in the city that hasn't been decimated...for now."
"What do you mean for now?" You ask.
"The riots are beginning to head this way, and when they do this place is not going to be safe, we're going to try to last as long as we can but I don't think we're going to survive the next attack."
"Can't you call for help?" You ask.
"We've tried, but nobody is answering, probably too busy with their own problems."
"What's going on out there?!" You ask exasperated
"It's the end of the world..."
"Of course it is, I already knew that..." You mutter to yourself.
"So what's the plan?" You ask louder.
"The only plan is to survive as long as we can and hope someone comes to rescue us." The voice states.
"Anyone been out to the city? Maybe we could get a better idea of what's going on?" You ask.
"A few people have been, but they didn't come back, if you go out there you probably won't come back either." The voice answers.
"I have to try."
"This was also why we built the tanks in the first place, so people could survive, I wish I'd opted out like some others had..."
You pause as you realize the person on the other end is beginning to break down in tears.
"Alright, alright, calm down, we'll get out of this." You say in as soothing a voice you can muster.
"How?" The person asks.
"I'll think of something, first things first, what's your name?"
"Carla"
"Alright Carla, I'm going to get you out of there."
"I'll try to find some way of opening up your tank, just hold on..." You say.
You move towards the door of the room and it slides open. You find yourself in a huge warehouse, with dozens upon dozes of large tanks, all hooked up to machines with long tubes snaking in and out of them. In front of you is a long corridor with windows on one side looking into the tanks, probably where Carla is. You see a half dozen figures in the distance, lurking, watching the tanks. They wear torn, ragged clothings and appear to be human, at least most of them do.
One of them seems to be half rotted, its flesh appearing more like that of a dead person and its body covered in worms and maggots. You shudder at the sight of them.
You know that you need to get Carla out, but you're going to have to deal with these Creations if you want to reach her in time, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to rescue her at all.
You could head to the control room and launch the gas that is meant to keep the humans alive, and would likely kill the Creations instead.
You could ambush the Creations as they creep towards the tanks, though you'd have to deal with them individually.
You could head back outside and see if you can find any other way in.
You could simply wait, and hope that the Creations wander away or lose interest.
You've decided to brave the creepy corridor and try to reach Carla and the others, but as you creep down the corridor towards the tanks, you notice a change in environment.
The corridor is dimly lit by globes of light in each corner, and the walls are a pristine white. However, as you creep down it, the lights begin to flicker, before blinking out.
You're in darkness, and you take the opportunity to pause and listen. You hear a creaking, groaning sound nearby.
You try to peer into the darkness, but it's impenetrable, all you can make out is your own breathing and the pounding of your own heart. You wait impatiently for your eyes to adjust, and that's when you feel it. A cold breath on the back of your neck, as if something with ice cold lips has just kissed you gently.
A laugh erupts out of the darkness, a horrible, high pitched voice, sounding almost like a child's, but ancient and full of decay.
"The lights are out!" The voice squeals.
The lights flicker back on, and you see a figure standing in the corridor ahead of you. It's small, misshapen, with bulging eyes and a tooth filled mouth, dressed in a child-size suit three sizes too big, all stained with food and mud. If it wasn't for the obscene eyes, you might mistake it for a human child. The figure stands with its hands in its pockets, leaning towards you. You see more of them, in the corridor to the left, and right. They don't move, simply staring at you.
"W-who are you?" You ask.
The first figure doesn't respond, instead, it motions to the others, and they move forward. You try to back up, but the wall is already at your back. Ahead of you, the horde of Creations moves forward in a wave, stopping a few feet in front of you. Then, they start to slide to the side, forming a circle. You hear a scream off to the side, and see Carla being dragged into the center, naked and covered in mud. She's struggling against her bindings, but it's no use. The Creations have formed a circle around her, just out of reach of her arms.
The creature that lead you here steps forward. It stares at you, motionless, for a few seconds, before leaning in and kissing you on the lips. You feel your stomach turn, and can barely muster the strength to push it away. As it steps back, it looks at you with its bulging eyes, and motions towards Carla.
"This one is fertile," it says, "You may take her now."
The creatures around Carla shuffle forward, grabbing her and holding her still as one of them takes a knife to her chest, slicing it open to allow her organs to fall out. She lasts only seconds more as they begin to feed on her innards.
The one that lead you here looks at you again.
"Take one of us with you, as your wife."
You look at it, disgusted with its offering.
"I thought you were a virgin."
"I am," it says, "But I'm still a woman. We can give ourselves to you, if you save us."
You look at the circle of creatures, and beyond them, to Carla's ravaged corpse.
"Alright," you say, "I'll take one of you with me."
The creature's eyes light up, and it grins.
"I knew you would!" it says, "I'm the most attractive out of all of us!"
You stare at it. It's disfigured, underfed body is hardly something you'd consider attractive, let alone a woman. The creature notices your hesitation.
"I know I may not look like one," it says, "But deep down, I am. My name is Alri."
"Well... Alri. What now?"
"Now, we must breed, so that our species may live on."
The creature suddenly grabs your hand and places it on its crotch, as it moves in to kiss you.
"Wait, wait, wait," you say, pushing it away.
"You promised me to breed with me!" The creautre says, looking hurt.
"I'll hold up my end of the bargain, but let's not do it here. Let's go somewhere less... morbid."
The creature looks around at the torsos feasting on Carla's organs, and nods.
"Okay. Let's go to your hut."
"No, let's go elsewhere. Like... the forest."
The creature thinks for a second.
"I know a good spot," it says, "Follow me."
Alri turns and leads you out of the warehouse, into the cold outside. The drifting fog that clouds your mind seems to lift for a second, but soon the thoughts of morality are clouded once again. The world seems to turn into a blur, as you walk with the creature towards an uncertain fate.
You wake up in a small cave, covered in dew. You leap up, looking around frantically. You're in a small cave, the light from outside casting a beam of light through the leaves and into your resting place. You can hear birds tweeting in the distance, but you can hear nothing else.
You feel your side, and find the lute still there. You sigh in relief, and stand, walking out towards the light as you stretch.
You walk out into the forest, a beautiful place of life and colors. Small flowers poke out from the verdant undergrowth, and a small stream trickles over blue-green algae. You walk along it for a moment, thinking, before you leap onto a rock and jump up onto another rock platform, where Carla is sitting. Carla, her belly bulging with her and your child, is sitting and leaning back, a dark green blanket spread out over her protruding stomach. Her long brown hair flows down her shoulders and back, as she looks up and smiles.
"I thought I heard you up," she says.
"Where are we?"
Carla smiles, and holds up a wooden stick with a blob of white paste on the end.
"Just some old beehive. We're right above it. Care for some?"
You shrug, and Carla smiles. She takes a stick of her own from a bag next to her and bites the end off, before offering it to you. You take a bite, and instantly, the smells of the forest are amplified twentyfold. You can smell the peaty soil, the fresh humus, the blossoming flowers and the many creatures that skitter through the undergrowth.
You jump onto the blanket with Carla, who puts her arm around you.
"This is nice," she smiles.
"We should head back to the village," you say, even though you really don't want to.
"Really? Why?" Carla asks.
"We need to head back."
"I suppose you're right," Carla says. "I'm feeling a little sick again. It's always worst after I eat."
You help Carla off the rock, and pack everything into the bag. Carla slings it over her shoulder, before leaning into you, her head against your side.
"You won't leave me, will you?" she asks.
"No, Carla, I promise I won't," you reply.
Carla smiles, then starts walking alongside you. The two of you walk through the woods together, heading back towards the village.
Elana looks up as you enter the hut, a smile upon her face.
"Back so soon?" she asks. "I guess the hunt was good?"
Carla shakes her head, and you explain what happened. Elana's smile drops, as she frowns.
"What sort of devil was it?" she asks.
"A new one," you admit. "We didn't realize..."
"It's fine," she assures you. "At least you're back safe."
You smile, and hold Elana close to you.
"What are you doing tonight?" she asks.
"I was planning on going out..." you say, as Elana shakes her head.
"Stay in. I'll cook you my famous stew, and then we can make bread together."
You smile, and kiss her.
"I'd like that," you admit.
"Good," Elana smiles. "Make sure you wipe your feet before coming into the house!"
You laugh, and head to the backyard to soak up the sun for a while.
The next few weeks are good ones. You spend your nights hunting with Pike and Carter, while spending your days with the girls. You're getting on fine with most of the villagers, though there are a few that shun you. The blacksmith's daughter, a pretty blond girl called Cecilia, outright refuses to leave her room when you come to visit. You try to be polite, but the rest of them are just so happy that you're there to help that they don't mind you sleeping in the barn.
The only real problem is that you're starting to feel trapped. You're happy to help these people, but you feel like you're losing your edge. The sun is too bright, the food is too good and the people are too nice. You're not used to company, and you're getting a little frustrated with the pleasantries and niceties. You long for something more exciting, more dangerous. Eventually, you find it.
"There's a beast in the woods," Elana says nervously one night. "It comes near the village at night, it's been attacking our livestock."
"I'll hunt it tonight," you say.
You spend the rest of the day as normal, smiling and chatting to the villagers.
Then, as night falls, you head to the woods with your bow.
As you enter the trees, you pause, sniffing the air. You can smell something... strange. An odor, not unlike that of a animal, but much stronger and more pungent. You can barely smell it through the thicker, heavier scent of the trees, but it's definitely... there.
You pause, revolving constantly as you try to find the direction of the smell. Then you see it, peeking out from behind a tree. It's a creature, roughly the size of a bear but with long, thin limbs, down on all fours, but it walks upright like a man. It's skin is a deep green, almost black, and looks almost... slimy. It's covered in bright red spots, as if it was suffering from a severe rash, and it's hair is thin and sparse, except for around its eyeridges and pointy ears. It's lips are pulled back, revealing rows of teeth that look almost like tiny spears. It lets out a growl, revealing this frightening detail. You're certain that if it wasn't holding something shiny in its hands, you'd mistake it for a monster.
It must be what's been terrorizing the village.
The creature charges at you, roaring aggressively. It must have found and snatched the poor guard's weapon, and thought it could scare you off. It has no idea what it's gotten itself into.
You draw your blade, slashing at the creature as it charges towards you. It dodges your strike quickly, but trips over a tree root and collapses to the floor, where your blade finds its neck. It gasps pitifully as its neck is opened up, bleeding rapidly. It looks at you desperately, scared and in pain. You spare it the pain of a death by starvation or getting mauled by wild animals by driving your sword through its head and ending its life.
You wipe your blade clean on the creature's fur and sheath it, before dragging the carcass with you. You leave a series of tracks, but you don't really care if someone finds them. Once back at the village, you dump the carcass in front of the council.
"There," you say. "Problem solved."
The men stare at the dead creature in shock, before looking up at you.
"You... killed the beast?" one asks.
"I did," you nod.
"But... you're a human!" another asks in shock.
"So?"
"So, you saved us!" the third says, a hint of hope entering his voice. "You really are an angel!"
"I didn't save you," you say. "I did it for my own reasons. I'm not an angel, and I won't be coming back."
"But... Will you at least tell us your name?" the first asks.
You pause, before nodding.
"Elana," you say.
You turn, and walk away from the village, never to return.
Over the next few decades you walk many miles, heading ever westward in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible. You destroy dozens of monsters, saving hundreds of humans. You give them all one piece of advice: "Head West."
The years pass quickly, and soon you find yourself an old woman, too old to be walking miles each day.
His name is Wet Dream and he's been laying under your bed for the past few hours.
"Finally," he says, pulling his glistening penis from your mouth. "I was beginning to think this bitch didn't know how to take a dick correct."
Wet Dream is a legendary juggalo. His mixtape, Peepshow, has a 5.0 on the Internet Ratings Index, the highest ranked album ever. He is one of the best music producers alive. He wears dark sunglasses and clown make up, like most juggalos.
He is a Faygo Knight, the highest rank one can achieve in the InsaneClown Posse fan club. He is covered in dozens of tattoos dedicated to ICP. His arms, legs, chest, and back are completely covered in them.
He has a large black hat with a long pink feather sticking out of it. His hat has sparkles on it, like a low-class hooker.
He wears black and blue board shorts, and a black wife beater. His arms, chest, and neck are as thick as a refrigerator. He has long, curly black hair, and a goatee.
He smiles at you, showing off a mouth full of yellow and rotten teeth.
"If you ever want a blowie again, you gotta let me cum inside ya."
